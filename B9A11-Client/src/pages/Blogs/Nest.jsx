          What is Nest Js
        </h1>
        <p className="mb-8">
          Nest.js is a progressive framework built for Node.js, primarily used
          in server-side application development. Its “progressive” nature
          allows developers to start with a core set of functionalities and
          gradually introduce additional modules as the application evolves.
          NestJS leverages TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, that enables
          developers to write cleaner and more maintainable code. Its modular
          architecture, built around decorators, offers a structured and
          flexible approach to server-side application development, making it an
          excellent option for writing APIs and backend services.

            Nestjs vs Nextjs: Which One to Choose?
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Choosing the right JavaScript framework can make or break your
            project. Today, we delve headfirst into Next.js and NestJS,
            examining their key features, use cases, and performance potential
            to help you make an informed decision. While both Nextjs and Nestjs
            sound similar, they serve different purposes. Choose NestJS if you
            need to work on your backend, while NextJS can be utilized to
            develop interactive web applications or front-end applications.
            However, NextJS can also be used as a full-stack development
            platform as it allows developers to write both server-side logic and
            interactive user interfaces with features like server-side rendering
            and static site generation. While NestJS focuses on backend
            development and NextJS tackles full-stack projects, they share a
            common goal — web application development. To choose the right
            framework or even consider using both, we will compare their
            strengths and weaknesses carefully. Let’s take a closer look at
            their capabilities.
